# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser based sketchpad/Etch-a-Sketch created to practice basic JavaScript.

To use, drag the cursor over cells in the sketch pad to fill them in. 

Tools above the sketch pad will change the fill color to a random RGB value, reset the pad, or increase the cell count for those finer detailed drawings.
